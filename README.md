=> Daily Problem Solving

Welcome to my Problem Solving repository! This project is dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills by tackling one coding problem every day using JavaScript.

=> Purpose

Build a consistent habit of solving algorithmic problems.
Strengthen proficiency in JavaScript programming.
Explore a wide range of topics including Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, and more.
Document my learning journey and solutions for future reference.

=> Repository Structure

Each  is organized in its own folder (Problem1, Problem2, etc.).

Inside each daily folder:

  -problem.md: Contains the problem statement and its source (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces).

  -solution.js: The JavaScript code for the solution.

  -README.md: Explanation of the solution, including the approach, time/space complexity, and any additional notes.







Resources

LeetCode: For a variety of algorithmic problems.
Codeforces: For competitive programming challenges.
HackerRank: For practice across different domains.
